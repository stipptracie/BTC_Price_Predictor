# Project 2: Crypto Predictor

## Team 1 Austin Means, Ryan Granston, Tracie Stipp

## Project Description
Crypto trading bot using machine learning.

## Research Questions
1. Can we use a combination of indicators to predict price movements?
2. Is there a correlation between BTC and alt coin price movements?
3. Does crypto sentiment correlate to price movements?
4. What is the best model for our project? XGBoost?

## Data Sets
1. CoinGecko
2. Bitcoin Sentiment
3. Yahoo Finance

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks
1. Test speed of API’s, do we need to save to csv?
2. Figure out if we need multiple API’s, or can we consolidate.
3. Develop which feature will work best for our bot.
4. Apply sets to different machine learning algorithms.
5. Display finds for presentation.
